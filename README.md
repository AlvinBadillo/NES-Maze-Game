NES Labyrinth Game Development:
Welcome to my NES Labyrinth Game Development project! This game was developed from scratch for the Nintendo Entertainment System (NES) using 6502 assembly language as part of a class project.

The primary goal of this project was to enhance my practical programming skills by developing a complex game from the ground up. This required a deep understanding of low-level programming concepts, particularly those related to assembly language, state machines, and memory management.

In this project, I've created an intricate labyrinth adventure game with several key features:

Intricate Mazes: Players navigate through complex mazes filled with twists, turns, and challenging puzzles.
Sophisticated State Machines: I've implemented advanced state machines to manage game states, ensuring smooth transitions and responsive gameplay.

This project not only showcases my ability to work with 6502 assembly language but also demonstrates my problem-solving skills and creativity in designing and implementing a fully functional game for the NES.
